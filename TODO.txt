1 -- add lust due to beast mastery (not registering because sourceName is the pet's name so UnitInRaid(sourceName) fails)
     Does UnitPlayerOrPetInRaid(sourceName) or UnitPlayerOrPetInParty(sourceName) work?

2 -- show in message who lusted

3 -- we should have a grace period where two bloodlusts cannot be shorter than.  That is, if two ppl cast bloodlust and
     their cast times differ by say 0.5 seconds, we should ignore the second one, assuming both pass the 'casted while
	 player was not sated' condition.
	 
4 -- Lock/Unlock and move while Unlock feature (also remember last frame position)

5 -- lust before boss engage doesn't fire

6 -- print message to chat option

7 -- maybe we should register for ENCOUNTER_START/ENCOUNTER_END because we can have this situation:
     kill trash then we add the boss.  When PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED fires, we don't have boss but then we
	 get boss... so addon does not activate...
	 
8 -- include version number in Interface Options Panel
